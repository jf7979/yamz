Yet Another Malware Zoo.

`This is my malware zoo. There are many like it but this one is mine. My malware zoo is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me, my malware zoo is useless. Without my malware zoo I am useless. I must manage my malware zoo true. I must document straighter than my enemy, who is trying to infect me. I must analyze him before he infects me. I will. Before God I swear this creed: my malware zoo and myself are defenders of my systems, we are the masters of my enemy, we are the saviors of my life. So be it, until there is no enemy, but peace. Amen.`


First off, the other malware zoo's/storage/analysis services are all likely to be better than this. This one is done in a a bunch of roundabout bash scripts mostly. But hey, bash is easy and this is easily expandable. But you should probably know how to troubleshoot pretty well since I can't account for every issue you may see. This is mainly aimed at combinging file analysis steps in to an automated system that keeps a history, not URL scanning.

**Features**
- Web Interface
- File upload history
- Easily expandable
- Exiftool analysis
- Hash listing
- Strings output
- Virustotal scan
- Metascan Online analysis
