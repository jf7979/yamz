Yet Another Malware Zoo.

This is my malware zoo. There are many like it but this one is mine. My malware zoo is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me, my malware zoo is useless. Without my malware zoo I am useless. I must manage my malware zoo true. I must document straighter than my enemy, who is trying to infect me. I must analyze him before he infects me. I will. Before God I swear this creed: my malware zoo and myself are defenders of my systems, we are the masters of my enemy, we are the saviors of my life. So be it, until there is no enemy, but peace. Amen.
